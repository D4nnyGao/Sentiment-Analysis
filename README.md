# Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

This project aimed to develop a sentiment analysis model to predict whether a movie review is positive or negative using natural language processing and machine learning techniques. By training and testing a Logistic Regression model on a labeled dataset of 50,000 movie reviews, we gained insights into public opinion and ensured the modelâ€™s generalizability through an external test set.
